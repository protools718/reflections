When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

From what I currently understand a reason to use a remote repository rather than local would be when working on a project that will involve multiple collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To allow to review commits to avoid conflicts
