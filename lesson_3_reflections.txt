When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

From what I currently understand a reason to use a remote repository rather than local would be when working on a project that will involve multiple collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To allow to review commits to avoid conflicts 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are for making a version that is seperate from the main version of code. An example would be to test a new feature or testing a bug fix.
Clones are copies of a remote repository. An example would be to download a repository to a local machine.
Forks are copying someone else code. When forking a copy is made to your remote (ie: Github) but it still maintains a link to the original code. You can suggest changes which the creator can review and commit to the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Offline line access of last known state so you can continue to work without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

One way of collaborating without Git or Github is using a cloud service like dropbox or Google docs. It would be different collaborating with multiple users since there is no system of verifying and commiting changes as provided in Git/Github. Though some of these services provide a version history it is not as robust and do not provide any comparison tools that would prevent an undesired overwrite for example.
