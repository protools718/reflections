What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running git init creates the .git direction which is required for git repository to begin to track changes. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle ground between the working directory and the repository. It value is that you can place files that you are ready to commit but gives you an opportunity to revise before creating a commit. One example would be working directory with multiple files. You can add and review the files that are relevant to the logical change you want to commit before doing so.
